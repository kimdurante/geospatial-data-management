**Collection Assessment**

GIS data are often acquired as collections. The definition of a collection as it applies to these kinds of data can be quite vague and might include one or more layers purchased from vendors, georeferenced maps, open data downloaded from a portal or website, or scholarly research data.

Survey the contents of the collection to check for things such as:

* Type(s) of data
* Total number of files
* Supplemental files (codebooks or csv/text/PDF/html documents containing metadata and other information)

Consider:

* What features do the data contain (i.e. population statistics, boundaries, geolocated imagery)
* Where they are located (geographic extent)
* When were they published and also in what time period are they situated (temporal extent)
* Who created and/or published the data
* Edition/version information
* What are the access and use restrictions (i.e. rights)

Opening and inspecting layers in a GIS is often required to gain an accurate understanding of the collection. Consultation with data providers may also be necessary.
