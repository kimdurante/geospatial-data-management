### Filenames

Filenames should contain only letters, numbers, or underscores. No other special characters should be used. When renaming files, be sure to rename all files uniformly.


| Invalid| Valid   |
| :----- |:-----|
|RIVERS&TRIBUTARIES.shp|RIVERS_TRIBUTARIES.shp|
|RIVERS&TRIBUTARIES.prj|RIVERS_TRIBUTARIES.prj|
|RIVERS&TRIBUTARIES.shx|RIVERS_TRIBUTARIES.shx|
|RIVERS&TRIBUTARIES.dbf|RIVERS_TRIBUTARIES.dbf|


In some cases errors can occur when file extensions are capitalized. Renaming the file may resolve this error.
