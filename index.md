# Overview

These guidelines outline operations for the management of geospatial data and metadata in the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR), the Stanford Spatial Data Infrastructure (SSDI), and EarthWorks (GeoBlacklight).

## GIS Data Formats

The following file formats are stored in SDR with both ISO and MODS metadata. These files are delivered through GeoServer:

* Shapefile
* GeoTIFF
* ArcGRID

All other file formats (geodatabases, geoPDFs, etc.) are stored in SDR with MODS metadata.

## Tools

In order to create metadata and accession content into SDR, you'll need ArcGIS software and access to Argo and GeoServer. 

Other tools such as Python, GDAL/OGR, QGIS, and Oxygen are useful for automating tasks and data analysis.
